# minimal-deezer-dl
An extremely barebones script to save tracks from Deezer. Inspired by [deezer.js](https://github.com/flazepe/deezer.js).

## Disclaimer
This does not directly save to a file. A `BytesIO` object is returned for use elsewhere. See [example.py](https://github.com/apex2504/minimal-deezer-dl/blob/master/example.py) for an example of saving to a file.

I'm not responsible for whatever you choose to do with this.

## Usage
See [example.py](https://github.com/apex2504/minimal-deezer-dl/blob/master/example.py).
